This is just some practice with CSS positioning and styling of buttons.  I was very new at the time, and have since gone back to make a few adjustments.  I wanted to leave most things alone though, as it shows how far I've come.

I find the absolute positioning hilarious now, along with many of the color choices, margin, and padding, but it's great to see what I did 5 months ago versus what I know not to do now.  There are quite a few other changes I'd make now that I've learned so much, but I enjoy going back and looking at these buttons to smile at the progress I've made.

This was one of my first "let's sit down and make something from scratch" projects, and while it certainly shows, I still admire the confidence I had back then to even try pseudo-elements and transitions!
